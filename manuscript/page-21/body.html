If I were a humourist, I should certainly be a Cockney humourist; if I were a saint, I should certainly be a Cockney saint. I need not recite the splendid catalogue of Cockney saints who have written their names on our noble old City churches.

We can weep together over the pathos of the poor Yorkshireman, whose county has never produced some humour not intelligible to the rest of the world.
